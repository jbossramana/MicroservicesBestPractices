Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) is a pattern that can be used in various scenarios to separate the responsibilities 
of handling commands (write operations) and queries (read operations) within an application. Here are some common usage scenarios for CQRS:

> Complex Domain Logic:

Usage: When dealing with complex business rules and domain logic, separating commands and queries can lead to clearer and more 
maintainable code. Commands handle the complexity of updating the domain model, while queries focus on retrieving data in a format 
suitable for presentation.

> Scalability:

Usage: CQRS can be beneficial in systems where the read and write loads vary significantly. By separating the read and write models, we 
can scale each independently based on their specific requirements. For example, you can optimize read models for high-performance querying 
and scale them horizontally to handle increased read requests.

> Performance Optimization:

Usage: Separating read and write operations allows you to optimize each path independently. Write operations can focus on ensuring 
data consistency and enforcing business rules without being constrained by read optimization concerns. Read models can be denormalized 
and tailored for efficient querying, improving overall system performance.



Use case examples where Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) can be applied:


> E-commerce Platform:

Write Side (Commands): Handling order creation, inventory management, payment processing, and user account updates.
Read Side (Queries): Generating product catalogs, order history, user profiles, sales reports, and analytics dashboards.

> Banking System:

Write Side (Commands): Processing fund transfers, managing account balances, updating transaction logs, and handling loan approvals.
Read Side (Queries): Displaying account statements, transaction history, balance inquiries, generating financial reports, and fraud detection analytics.

> Healthcare Management:

Write Side (Commands): Managing patient records, scheduling appointments, processing medical tests, and handling billing and insurance claims.
Read Side (Queries): Providing patient medical history, lab results, treatment plans, doctor schedules, and generating health trend reports.

> Social Media Platform:

Write Side (Commands): Managing user posts, comments, likes, friend requests, notifications, and privacy settings.
Read Side (Queries): Displaying user timelines, news feeds, trending topics, friend suggestions, engagement metrics, and content analytics.

> Transportation and Logistics:

Write Side (Commands): Handling shipment orders, route planning, tracking cargo, managing delivery schedules, and processing payments.
Read Side (Queries): Providing real-time shipment tracking, delivery status updates, performance metrics, optimizing delivery routes, and 
generating logistics reports.

> Human Resources Management:

Write Side (Commands): Managing employee data, processing payroll, handling leave requests, conducting performance reviews, and 
onboarding/offboarding employees.

Read Side (Queries): Displaying employee profiles, attendance records, salary statements, performance evaluations, workforce analytics, and 
HR dashboards.
