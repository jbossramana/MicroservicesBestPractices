The Onion Architecture, also known as Ports and Adapters architecture, is based on several key principles 
that guide the organization and design of software systems.


Layers of Abstraction

Explanation: The Onion Architecture emphasizes organizing the codebase into concentric layers of abstraction, 
with the core business logic at the center and infrastructure concerns at the outer layers.

Implementation in the Code:

1. Core Domain (Innermost Layer):

The Task class in the com.example.domain package represents the core business entity.

The TaskUseCase interface in the com.example.application.port package defines use case operations related to tasks, maintaining the 
core business logic.

2. Application Layer:

The TaskService in the com.example.application package implements business logic using the TaskUseCase interface, focusing on 
application-specific operations.

3. Infrastructure Layer (Outermost Layer):

The TaskRepository interface in the com.example.application.port package defines operations for data persistence, abstracting away
 the details of data access.
 
The TaskRepositoryImpl in the com.example.infrastructure.persistence package provides a specific implementation of the repository 
using persistence technologies (e.g., databases).

4. Presentaion Layer

The presentation layer handles user interactions, renders views, and communicates with the application layer (use cases) to 
perform business logic.
