limitRereshPeriod is the interval – in our case it is 5 seconds

limitForPeriod is number of requests to make every 5 seconds. In our case, it should be just 1.  
We want to make only one call every 5 second. All other requests should not be allowed within the 5 second window

timeoutDuration – additional requests within the 5 seconds should be timedout immediately.
