A ship is split into small multiple compartments using Bulkheads. Bulkheads are used to seal parts 
of the ship to prevent entire ship from sinking in case of flood. 

Similarly failures should be expected when we design software. The application should be split into 
multiple components and resources should be isolated in such a way that failure of one component 
is not affecting the other. 

Bulkhead ensures the failure in one part of the system doesn't cause the whole system down. 
It controls the number of concurrent calls a component can take. This way, the number of resources 
waiting for the response from that component is limited.
